# This program calculates the area of a rectangle
# It demonstrates proper indentation, comments, and variable naming (PEP 8)

# Define variables for length and width
length = 10      # Length of the rectangle (in units)
width = 5        # Width of the rectangle (in units)

# Calculate the area
area = length * width  # Formula: Area = Length Ã— Width

# Display the result
print("The area of the rectangle is:", area)
